# Bachelor thesis
My bachelor studies in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/ComputerScienceEngineering) at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en) started in **September 2017** and concluded in **October 2020** with a final graduation of **100/110**.

This repositoy contain the source **LaTeX** code used to create my **bachelor thesis**.

# General info
You can **download** the compiled PDF in the [releases section of this repository](https://github.com/Tale152/bachelor_thesis/releases) or using [University of Bologna's Theses Repository](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/21607/).  

Due to the fact that my studies were conducted in an italian university, this thesis is written in **italian**.  

The code in this repository was moved from a previous Bitbucket repository.  

The project that this thesis describes cannot be found publically because it is owned by the company that hosted this work.

# Thesis

## Contributors
In writing this thesis I was supervised by [Prof. Alessandro Ricci](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.ricci/cv-en).

The project was hosted by the italian company [Vibre](https://vibre.io/en/); during the development I was supported by [Dr. Luca Talevi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucatalevi/) and [Dr. Marco Renzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-renzi/). 
## Summary
The italian title of this thesis can be translated to **"Development of a real-time web application used for the cognitive well-being of a team"**.  

In the thesis is discussed the **study of the problem**, **modeling**, **implementation** and **validation** of a system used for the **cognitive well-being of a team of workers**.  
Using **neural helmets**, capable of performing a **real-time EEG**, the **cognitive well-being** of every team's member is elaborated by an algorithm producing **easy to read metrics**; said results will be shown in real-time on a **dashboard** controlled by a **Team manager** which, accordingly to the data, **will take decisions useful to motivate workers or give them some rest**.  
The system is **distributed**, composed by various sub-systems developed mainly using **web technologies**.
